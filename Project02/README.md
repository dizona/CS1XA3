### Hangman (Elm app)
##### Access:
To access the game, you must open up my cv web page https://mac1xa3.ca/u/dizona/ and scroll down to "Projects and Relevant Experiences." It is the first project listed and if you click on the title, "Hangman (Computer Science 1XA3 Project)," it will link you to the game.

##### How to Play:
You will first be greeted by the main menu where you will have to choose the category of the game. After that, the actual hangman game will appear. The game is like traditional hangman. You will get a total of 6 attempts to guess the word correctly and all your input will be from the letters on your keyboard. When you want to change the word becuase you won, loss or just can't get the word, there is a "New Word" button at the bottom of the page that you have to click on. Doing so, will give a new word and 6 attempts once again. To change categories, just refresh the web page and it will take you back to the main menu.
##### Notice: 
The keyboard input will track any key that is pressed, regardless of whether it is a letter or not. So be careful when playing!
