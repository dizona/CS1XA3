<h1> Adrian Dizon's Project01
<h2> Prompt:
<h4> For the prompt, I decided to go with the built in prompt instead of read. I chose to do this because
I want the user to enter multiple commands/functions they want to use and my script would be able to run them all.
In order to choose the function to be performed, the user has to type in one or more of the commands that will be listed
below (if the user is using more than one command, it must be separated with spaces)
<h2>TODO Function:
<h4>Enter "todo" (no quotes) next to ./project_analyze.sh
<h4>Example: ./project_analyze.sh todo
